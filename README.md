# Medicine-Assistant
This repository consists of an android application which is made to help the visually challenged organize and consume their daily medicines.

The interface of this app is entirely driven by audio instructions. Through this app the users can get to know the name and the expiry of the medicine from clicking its picture. The users also can know their prescriptions (text to speech conversion) and give their 
feedback (speech to text conversion). The backend for doing OCR from the images of the medicines was done in python and is hosted on 
Heroku. For storing the prescriptions and the feedbacks we are using Google's firebase.

This repository only consists the code for the front-end and not the back-end, for the code for the back-end please refer https://github.com/shubham0704/practo_hack_backend.
